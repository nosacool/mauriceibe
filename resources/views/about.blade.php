                        Africa’s Poor Communities are riddled with conflict, natural disasters, climate change, flooding, and extreme hunger.

                    The Foundation implements many projects of poverty eradication within the African Continent. Our working tools are education, economic development, health promotion and income redistribution. We also advocate for equal rights to economic resources amongst men and women and work with small-scale food producers, such as rural women, indigenous groups, family farmers and pastoralists, to improve their income and sources of livelihood. We support local indigenous initiatives by promoting self-reliance amongst women, men and youth within the African Continent.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We design our programs to meet these daily challenges. Our primary focus is on livelihoods, healthcare and nutrition, education, emergencies, gender equality and innovations.
                    At the core of who we are is empowering local communities to build their resilience and ensure their transformation is sustainable and long-lasting. Our aim is to achieve a vision of a region free of poverty, fear, disease and oppression.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our passionate advocacy is to feed the hungry, help the needy and politically under-represented people across the region. We are dedicated to poverty alleviation, through grassroots projects and educational initiatives.
                    We partner with other organizations to serve the communities in need, fund sustainable community initiatives and educate and raise awareness of economic and social issues related to poverty.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Maurice Ibe Fondation taps into the vast network of other NGO’s and non-profit organizations, volunteers, and donors to fight poverty in local communities. We support community-led projects to build leadership, and lift people out of poverty. With skills we provide, they create independent solutions for their future livelihoods.

                   <p style="text-align: justify" class="text wow fadeInRight">Our world is largely bedeviled by structural inequality mostly based on gender, race, class, disability, and ethnicity. These are very much complicated and persists around the world. It further compounded and complicated by today’s economic and social challenges.
                        Africa’s rural communities are infested with gender-based violence—rooted in patriarchy and encouraged by local laws, policies, and cultural norms.
                        These prejudices inflicts deep rooted and lasting physical harm, psychological and economic damage to those in the rural communities of Africa.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                        At Maurice Ibe Foundation, we are advancing new realities and engaging in innovative advocacy. We are placing our monies where our mouth is.    Help us change the world.
                        We are changing the social narratives of the third world, and forging powerful alliances to build a greater tomorrow.

                   </p>
                   <p>
                       Our young men and women around the world are yearning to be rescued out of poverty. They are crying for a better tomorrow, which can only be guaranteed by a good education.
                        Our work is to provide financial support to the millions of African youths, seeking a better life. We are building schools and feeding the poor. 	    Our intent is to fight to poverty to achieve lasting political and social change in our part of the globe.
                        We recognize that race, gender, class, disability, and ethnic identity are deeply connected—often inextricably so. Our new narrative is rooted in this understanding. It’s an understanding that informs our commitment to shifting repressive power dynamics and strengthening the rights and influence of those most affected by violence, oppression and injustice across Africa.
                    </p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify" class="text wow fadeInRight" style="margin-top:10px">
                            Around the world, women have become an unstoppable force. They are rewriting the rules and redefining power. Women are reimagining what equality looks like. In Africa, reverse is the case. Our girls are abused and neglected. Most are married off early, often times in their teenage years, yet others are constantly raped and confined to a life of servitude. You wonder why Africa is the epicenter of child trafficking.
                            At Maurice Ibe Foundation, we are mobilizing the power of people against poverty. We are taking the fight against poverty to the rural communities of Africa. We do not stop at the glorified slums of the cities and urban areas, but to the undeserved, under serviced and under nourished rural communities of Africa.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We work with local communities across the continent. We are rebuilding livelihoods and creating innovative practical solutions for rural dwellers to end poverty.
                            Our mantle is that opportunity is not a privilege, but a right for everyone and every child. At our core is working with partner organizations to end the injustices that cause poverty. It is our responsibility to raise the voices of the poor on local and global agendas and to influence decisions that affects Africa’s poor and destitute.
                            We champion  Poverty Alleviation and Human Capital Development.
                            Our foundation feeds the hungry, heals the sick and champions the education of poor and helpless children.
